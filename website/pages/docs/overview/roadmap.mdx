# The Future of Mix
We are excited to announce the release of Mix 1.0.0! This release is a major milestone in the development of Mix, and we are excited to share it with you. The version 1.0.0 means that we have reached a stable API, and we are confident that the API. Through this Roadmap, we will be able to share our plans for future of Mix.

## Use cases for Mix
We've been working on Mix for a long time to solve the styling problem of Flutter. Part of build a solution is show you how Mix was planned to be used. Because of this, **we will spend some time creating real projects using Mix**.

## Our own Design System: Remix
We are also planning to create a Design System based on Mix. This Design System will be called **Remix**. This Design System has the goal to be completely styleable and flexible in the same way as Mix. You can follow the progress of this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/conceptadev/remix_ui).

## A custom lint for Mix
While Mix was being created took note of the best practices and the common mistakes that developers make when using Mix. That's the why, we want to create a custom lint for Mix. This lint will help developers to avoid common mistakes and to use Mix in a better way.

## Validation of codegen approach
Mix by default requires a lot of boilerplate code to work, specially, when you need to create a custom `StyleWidget`. We are planning to use a codegen approach to generate this boilerplate code.
