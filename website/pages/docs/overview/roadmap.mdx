# The Future of Mix
We are excited to announce the release of Mix 1.0.0! This release is a major milestone in the development of Mix, and we are thrilled to share it with you. The version 1.0.0 signifies that we have reached a stable API, and we are confident in this API. Through this Roadmap, we will share our plans for the future of Mix.

## Use cases for Mix
We've been working on Mix for a long time to solve the styling problem in Flutter. Part of building a solution is showing you how Mix was planned to be used. Because of this, we will spend some time creating real projects using Mix.

## Our own Design System: Remix
We are also planning to create a Design System based on Mix. This Design System will be called **Remix**. The goal of this Design System is to be completely styleable and flexible in the same way as Mix. You can follow the progress of this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/conceptadev/remix_ui).

## A custom lint for Mix
While Mix was being created, we took note of the best practices and the common mistakes that developers make when using Mix. That's why we want to create a custom lint for Mix. This lint will help developers avoid common mistakes and use Mix in a better way.

## Validation of codegen approach
Mix, by default, requires a lot of boilerplate code to work, especially when you need to create a custom `StyleWidget`. We are planning to use a codegen approach to generate this boilerplate code.
